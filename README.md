# Executive Project Summary
* What doing? Hacking a cheap IoT security camera  
    * Cameras nowadays are affordable and easy to set up. Full of wifi features. Popular. (Delve into convenience and sense of security)  
* Important? Compromised device can lead to unwanted spying, learning patterns of tenants (break in when no one is home; lost sense of security).  
## Goals and objectives
* Build experience practicing skills learned in coursework
* Pentest camera with a variety of methodologies
    * Intercept video/remotely control device
    * Test if vulnerable to spoofed network
    * Create a botnet using multiple cameras
* Deliver best practice guide, highlighting vulnerabilities to minimize threat space
## Merit of the Project
* With IoT cameras gaining popularity, finding and sharing weaknesses so they can be patched is benficial to everyone  
* If no vulnerabilities are found, can add comfort to the idea of consumers trusting these devices

# Project-oriented Risk List
Some things that can go wrong:

|Risk name (value)  | Impact     | Likelihood | Description |
|-------------------|------------|------------|-------------|
|Brick security camera (30) | 6 | 5 | It's possible that we may brick the security camera while trying to gain access to it via the hardware |
|Corrupt micro SD card (20) | 4 | 5 | It's possible that we may corrupt an SD card while attempting to gain access to the device using the SD card |
|Team member being unavailable/unwilling to help (32) | 8 | 4 | There may be a loss in productivity if one or more team members are unable to cooperate |
|Cannot attack via network (15) | 3 | 5 | There may be no network-based vulnerabilities |
|Cannot attack via micro SD card (15) | 3 | 5 | There may be no way to attack through the SD card |

# Project Methodology
Perform research on how to best approach this project.  
*Ask for further detail here*
## Literature Review
## Technical Plan
# Resources/Technology needed
Spoofing devices - pineapple from Hale? -See Echo Example
Micro SD cards
*hacking tools. Need to do research*

|Resource  | Dr. Hale needed? | Investigating Team member | Description |
|-------------------|---------|---------------------------|-------------|
|EZVIZ CTQ2C| no | Everyone | this allows everyone to do independent research |
|Some resource| yes/no | name | Some description  |

# First Sprint Plan
I'm familiar with Kanban but I don't know how to integrate it in gitHub
