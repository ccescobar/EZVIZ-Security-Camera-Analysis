# Executive Project Summary
* What doing? Hacking a cheap IoT security camera  
    * Cameras nowadays are affordable and easy to set up. Full of wifi features. Popular. (Delve into convenience and sense of security)  
* Important? Compromised device can lead to unwanted spying, learning patterns of tenants (break in when no one is home; lost sense of security).  
## Goals and objectives
* Build experience practicing skills learned in coursework
* Pentest camera with a variety of methodologies
    * Intercept video/remotely control device
    * Test if vulnerable to spoofed network
    * Create a botnet using multiple cameras
* Deliver best practice guide, highlighting vulnerabilities to minimize threat space
## Merit of the Project
* With IoT cameras gaining popularity, finding and sharing weaknesses so they can be patched is benficial to everyone  
* If no vulnerabilities are found, can add comfort to the idea of consumers trusting these devices
